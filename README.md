# covid-tracker

Track covid-19 data from state websites.

This site was build early during the covid-19 pandemic when there was not a lot of publicly available up to date data. The app scraped state department of health websites every 5 minutes of states where I had close family. If state data updated, it was stored and displayed on a simple web page for my family's viewing.

Fortunately, much better tools became available as the pandemic rolled on, so I retired this project.
